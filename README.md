# Pricing American options with binomial trees

This is my project submitted for the Fall 2025 Quant Finance course at Erdos Institute.

Goals:
* Explore the different aspects of American vs European options. As American options can be exercised before the expiration time, Black-Sholes does not yield the closed form for call/put option pricing.
* Realize some of the standard and well-known binomial models: CRR (Cox-Ross-Rubinstein), JR (Jarrow-Rudd) and Tian binomial tree models.
* Test the implementations using the yfinance data.


Nice things to do in the future:
* Realize option pricing schemes using Levy processes
* Obtain more data for stocks on other non-US based exchanges?
